# MonoWeather 

A simple weather app for monochrome displays (like an Amazon Kindle).

## Disclaimer

This app is optimized for a Kindle 4 device (600x800, which is 600x740 actually).

## Todo
* Make this a real thing that works
  * Parse weather data
  * Let client update themself
  * Update temparture values 
  * Update images (svg)
* Some Hints (you may call it a "documentation" how to configure a Kindle to this usage)
* Search by City + Country
* Use a real domain
