# MonoWeather 

A simple weather app for monochrome displays as an Amazon Kindle.

## Disclaimer

This app is optimized for a Kindle 4 device, because that's the thing I have right here next to me.

## Todo
* Make this a real thing that works
  * Parse weather data
  * Send weather data to client
  * Let client update themself
  * Crop svg to real size
  * Update temparture values 
  * Update images (svg)
* Some Hints (you may call it a "documentation" how to configure a Kindle to this usage
* Search by City + Country
* Use a real domain
